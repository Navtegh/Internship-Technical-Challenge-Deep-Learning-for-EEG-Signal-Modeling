EEG Signal Classification

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of different deep learning models for EEG signal classification. The models tested include EEGNet, CNN, CNN-GRU, LSTM, and Transformer-based architectures.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify EEG signals using different deep learning architectures and analyze their performance in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalization across subjects.

ðŸš€ Models Implemented

EEGNet (Lightweight CNN for EEG classification)

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

CNN + GRU (Hybrid model combining CNN and Gated Recurrent Unit)

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Network)

Transformer (Self-attention based model for sequence learning)
